# Exercise 3 (plus extra credit items)

puts "I will now count my chickens:"

# Counts my chickens. 
# Perhaps there are 2 hen houses, and I share the 30 hens in one with 5 other people
# 30 divided by six plus 25 printed to screen.
puts "Hens", 25 + 30 / 6

# Perhaps I'm rooster rich and hen poor, and have really over complicated thier allocation with my fellow chicken farmers
# 25 multiplied by 3, modulo 4, subtracted from 100 printed to screen.
puts "Roosters", 100 - 25 * 3 % 4

puts "Now I will count the eggs:"

# 1 divided by 4, subtracted from 4 modulo 2, plus 3 plus 2 plus 1 minus 5 plus 6 printed to screen.
puts 3.0 + 2.0 + 1.0 - 5.0 + 4.0 % 2.0 - 1.0 / 4.0 + 6.0
# original must round up to integer... yes it does, easy fix.

puts "Is it true that 3 + 2 < 5 - 7?"

# determines if 3 plus 2 is less than five minus seven, and prints result to screen
puts 3 + 2 < 5 - 7

# adds 3 and 2 then prints results to screen.
puts "What is 3 + 2?", 3 + 2
# subtracts 5 from 7 then prints results to screen.

puts "Oh, that's why it's false."

puts "How about some more."

# Determines if 5 is greater than minus 2 then prints results to screen.
puts "Is it greater?", 5 > -2

# Determines if 5 is greater than or equal to minus 2 then prints results to screen.

# Determines if 5 is less than or equal to minus 2 then prints results to screen.
